# appengine-pusher
A dead-simple demo using <a href="http://pusher.com" target="_blank">Pusher</a> on Google App Engine. After doing plenty of googleing, there simply isn't any decent demos which are lightweight enough to implement Pusher quickly into your App Engine projects. 


## Getting started
Create your <b>settings.py</b> file
```
pusher_app_id = "x"
pusher_key = "x"
pusher_secret = "x"
```

Add your pusher key to index.html
```
var pusher_key = "x";
```

and you're good to go!
